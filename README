This software want's to be an easy access to different possibility of kinect threw OSC for non programmer people.
Actually it still need to have an xcode or equivalent installed on your mac to compile and install openNI driver.
This software is made in OpenFrameworks and mostly based on gameoverhack ofxOpenNI port https://github.com/gameoverhack/ofxOpenNI

Need to have openNI, kinect driver and NITE algorithm installed on your computer.
This software as only been tested on mac platform
OpenNI : https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI/tree/unstable
driver : https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
Nite : http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/12-openni-compliant-middleware-binaries

Already done :
- track multiple users into space and send their position in world coordinates threw OSC
- there is different format for sending data :
	- normal : /user/data idUser posX posY posZ
	- full user : /user/data idUser posX posY posZ xMin xMax yMin yMax zMin zMax
	- separate data : 	/user/idUser/data/x posX
						/user/idUser/data/x posY
						/user/idUser/data/x posZ
- track hands
	- still some bugs in OSC. Doesn't delete lost hands
	
todo :
- track and send skeleton data
- send mask of users threw syphon
- correct lost hand bugs
- add gesture recognition
- camera virtuelle pour corriger les coordonnées reel de l'espace du kinect a celui d'une camera virtuelle.
